## App Brainstorming

List of favorite applications and why
1. Duolingo
    - Duolingo has a green friendly color scheme and has a simple font for everyone to understand. 
    - The app is very interactive and has nice animations along with sounds.
    - There is barely any lag, so I learn French with maximum engagement.
    - The app is highly optimized, and the ads don't make my screen inputs buffer.

2. Tiktok
    - Tiktok has a camera option that allows me to take videos
    - There is an editor in titkok as well that allows me to add filters, sounds etc.
    - The app is easy to use: I can swipe, like, follow, refresh, and record all in one finger action.

3. Youtube
    - I like Youtube because it is easy to use and I can watch a variety of long videos.
    - The Youtibe feed is personalized based on my watch history, and I receive recommendations that are relevant to me.

Other app idea that I want to build
- I would like to build a skincare app called "Glow Skin." Upon initial installation, it will need an intro page with a few slides showcasing what the app does - providing skincare tips, saving routines and providing links to buy products from other stores - and initializing user preferences. After, the user is asked to enter login information for personalized app experience. Once authentication is finished, the user is greeted with a home page of some warm color schemes such as gold and translucent warm purple. The home page has a bottom task bar that consists of a home button, a “my skin” button,  a “my products” button, a “my routine” button, and a help button. On the top left corner of the home page will be a settings button that a user can use to change account settings, preferences, skin type, etc. Each of the buttons on the taskbar will transition to a corresponding screen. So clicking on the “my routine button” for example, will update the screen and show you a screen of a specialized routine that the user created or can create by selecting what products they use and what time (am or pm) they should be followed by. The bottom task bar will still be at the bottom of the screen so the user can easily go back to the homepage or any other screens (sections).



## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app.
- The emulator needed the latest iOS 17.2 version in order to run, but xCode could not download it until the Mac was restarted.
- Issues with Github: Needed to redownload Github desktop before I could sign into Github and clone the repository.
- Lost connection to the IBAction when its name was changed.
